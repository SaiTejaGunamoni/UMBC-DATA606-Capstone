## Academic Projects
**Predicting Credit Card Defaulters using Machine Learning | Python, Tensor Flow, Machine Learning, MongoDB.**
- Developed a machine learning solution that improved risk management and increased collections success by 20% using Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras.
- Strong feature selection algorithm was created and put into practice to speed up model training. This resulted in a 40% reduction in feature dimensionality and a 15% improvement in model performance. 
- KMeans clustering was utilized to segment customers based on their purchase behavior, allowing for customized incentives and promotions.

**Investigating Crime Determinants and Neighborhood Crime Rates | Python, R, Machine Learning, Tableau.**
- Analyzed the relationship between unoccupied properties, pest control activity (rat-rub outs), and  population density with crime rates across a city.
- Employed statistical methods to assess the influence of these factors on crime variations within  neighborhoods and throughout the city over a six-year period.

**High Speed Multiplier using Embedded Approximate 4-2 Compressor for Image Multiplication | VerilogHDL, Cadence.**
- In this project we proposed an 8X8 Dadda multiplier with approximated 4:2 compressor. 
- Multiplication of two images on pixel-by-pixel basis will be done with this multiplier. The proposed multiplier has an advantage over precise multipliers in terms of design parameters as well as accuracy metrics
